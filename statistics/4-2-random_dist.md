[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Plotting the CDF of 1000 random numbers, it appears that the values generated by random.random are indeed random.
>> The PMF plot is less illuminating.
```python
import thinkstats2
import random
v=[random.random() for _ in range(1000)]
pmf=thinkstats2.Pmf(v)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Show() #this is hard to visualize
cdf=thinkstats2.Cdf(v)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show() #this makes it clear they the values at least somewhat random
```
